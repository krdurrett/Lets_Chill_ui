## Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Let's Chill is a Mod 3 solo-project at the Turing School of Software and Design that was built with `create-react-app` and tested using Cypress. React, React Router and data pulled from a backend server I created were used to display certain feelings of anxiety and actions to treat anxiety. The user can select how they are currently feeling and see a list of actions to address how they are feeling. They can view details about that action, and they have the option to log the action, whether or not it helped, and the date. Additionally, the user will find Let's Chill to be a responsively designed application that they may use on many different screens.

## Code Architecture <a name="codeArchitecture"></a>

The React architecture is based on five class components (App.js, ActionDetails.js, ChillLogContainer.js, FeelingsForm.js, LogForm.js) and eleven functional components (Action.js, ActionDetailContainer.js, ActionsContainer.js, ChillLogLink.js, DetailNav.js, Entry.js, Error404.js, ErrorModal.js, Loading.js, MainNav.js, Nav.js). The class components hold state and are in charge of the network requests, while the functional components render information passed down as props.
